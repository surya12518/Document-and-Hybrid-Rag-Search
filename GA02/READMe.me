# 🔍 Hybrid RAG Search Engine

**An intelligent multi-document search system that combines local document knowledge with real-time web search for comprehensive, up-to-date answers.**

---

## 🏢 Project Overview

This project was developed as an **Enterprise Knowledge Intelligence Platform** that solves the critical business challenge of information fragmentation. Organizations store valuable knowledge across multiple unstructured documents (PDFs, reports, notes) but often need current, real-world information to make informed decisions.

The Hybrid RAG Search Engine bridges this gap by combining **semantic document search** with **real-time web intelligence**, providing organizations with a single interface to access both their internal knowledge base and external information sources.

## 🧠 Core Objectives

- Build a **multi-document semantic search** system using FAISS vector storage
- Integrate **real-time web search** via Tavily for current information
- Implement **intelligent query routing** to determine optimal search strategy
- Create **transparent citation system** distinguishing document vs web sources
- Develop **enterprise-grade UI** using Streamlit for user interaction
- Ensure **answer grounding** with clear source attribution
